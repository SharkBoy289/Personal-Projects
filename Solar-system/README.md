# Next.js + Tailwind CSS Example

Tailwind CSS is integrated into the `create-next-app` CLI, which supports TypeScript and JavaScript, as well as the App Router (`app/`) and the pages directory `pages/`.

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/SharkBoy289/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Solar-System) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap a project preconfigured with Tailwind CSS:

```bash
npx create-next-app --tailwind with-tailwindcss-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --tailwind with-tailwindcss-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --tailwind with-tailwindcss-app
```
